# 🎯 Math Quiz Game in C++ 🧮

An interactive console-based math quiz game built in C++ that challenges players with randomly generated arithmetic questions. Players can select difficulty levels and operation types, and the game provides real-time feedback with color-coded results. 🎨✅❌

## 🚀 Features

✅ Play up to **100 questions** per round  
✅ Choose from **Easy, Medium, Hard, or Mixed** difficulty levels  
✅ Supports **Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/)**  
✅ **Randomized questions** for a unique experience each time  
✅ **Color-coded feedback**:  
   - 🟩 **Green** for correct answers  
   - 🟥 **Red + Sound** for incorrect answers  
   - 🟨 **Yellow** for a draw  
✅ **Final score summary**  
✅ Option to **play again**
